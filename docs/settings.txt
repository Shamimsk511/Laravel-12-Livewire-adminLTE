System settings allow you to configure global values that are shared across modules.

Available keys:
- shop_name: name of the shop displayed in invoices and headers.
- currency: default currency code (e.g. USD).
- address: company address shown on documents.

Use the Settings menu to modify these values. Modules can retrieve them via the
`setting('key')` helper, which caches results for better performance.
